# rail-fence-cipher
##### This is a simple rail fence encryption algorithm written in C++
##### The fence (zigzag) can start from top or form the bottom.

### Please note that rail fence cipher is a vey simple and easy to crack cipher. I would never recommend using it to secure any important piece of information.

#### example use

##### start "rail fence cipher.exe"

##### 123456789
##### Enter the fence's height
##### 4
##### Type in 0 if you want the zig-zag to start from the top or 1 if you want it to start from the bottom
##### 0
